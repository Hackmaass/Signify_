PROJECT WRITEUP: Signify

PROJECT NAME: Signify - Your Personal AI-Powered ASL Tutor

OVERVIEW:
Signify is an innovative, gamified education platform designed to make learning American Sign Language (ASL) accessible, interactive, and effective. By leveraging advanced webcam-based hand tracking and state-of-the-art Generative AI, Signify provides a "Live Tutor" experience that watches you sign and offers instant, personalized corrections—just like a real teacher.

GOOGLE TECHNOLOGIES IMPLEMENTED:
Signify is built on a robust foundation of Google's cutting-edge tools and services:

1.  🧠 **Google Gemini AI Models**:
    *   **Gemini 3 Flash Preview**: The core intelligence engine. It powers the "Live Tutor" vision capabilities, analyzing static and dynamic hand signs in real-time to provide semantic feedback (e.g., "Straighten your thumb"). It also generates custom lesson plans dynamically from user input.
    *   **Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (TTS)**: Powers the conversational interface. We utilize the Native Multimodal Live API capabilities (specifically Text-to-Speech) to give the AI a natural, encouraging voice (Voice: 'Kore') that speaks corrections and affirmations to the learner.

2.  🖐️ **Google MediaPipe**:
    *   **Hands Solution**: Running client-side directly in the browser, MediaPipe tracks 21 distinct 3D landmarks on the user's hands. This allows for privacy-preserving, ultra-low-latency tracking that only sends data to the AI when a specific sign needs detailed semantic analysis.

3.  🔥 **Firebase (Google Backend as a Service)**:
    *   **Authentication**: Secure email/password login system.
    *   **Cloud Firestore**: A NoSQL cloud database used to store user profiles, learning history, streaks, and progress stats in real-time.
    *   **Infrastructure**: Provides the serverless backend infrastructure that scales automatically.

4.  🎨 **Google Fonts**:
    *   **Inter**: Utilized for the primary typography to ensure a clean, modern, and accessible reading experience across all devices.

KEY FEATURES:

1.  📷 **Real-Time Hand Tracking**
    -   Utilizes **Google MediaPipe** for instant client-side skeletal tracking.
    -   Visualizes hand landmarks on screen for immediate visual feedback.
    -   Privacy-focused: Raw video feeds are processed locally; only snapshots are analyzed by Gemini when feedback is requested.

2.  🤖 **AI-Powered Live Tutor**
    -   **Vision Analysis**: **Gemini 3 Flash** evaluates the user's hand shape, orientation, and motion against the correct ASL sign.
    -   **Natural Voice**: **Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS** provides spoken feedback, creating a conversational coaching loop.
    -   **Granular Feedback**: Detects subtle errors (e.g., thumb tuck, palm orientation) that traditional classifiers miss.

3.  📚 **Smart Curriculum & Generative Lessons**
    -   **Static & Dynamic Signs**: Covers the ASL Alphabet (A-Z) and common dynamic phrases ("Hello", "Thank You").
    -   **AI Generator**: Type *any* word or phrase, and **Gemini 3** instantly creates a structured lesson plan with descriptions, difficulty ratings, and instructions.

4.  🔥 **Gamification & Progress**
    -   **Daily Streaks**: Logic stored in **Firestore** tracks consecutive practice days.
    -   **Quota Tracker**: Visualizes daily AI API usage limits.
    -   **Smart History**: Remembers your past lessons and scores.

5.  ✨ **Modern Aesthetic**
    -   **Glassmorphism UI**: A premium, dark-mode design using **Tailwind CSS**.
    -   **Interactive Animations**: **Framer Motion** and **GSAP** bring the interface to life.

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
-   **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, TypeScript
-   **AI**: Google Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS
-   **Computer Vision**: Google MediaPipe Hands
-   **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore)
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React
-   **Animations**: Framer Motion, GSAP
-   **Deployment**: Vercel

ENGINEERING HIGHLIGHTS:
-   **Hybrid AI/CV Architecture**: Combines the speed of MediaPipe (30+ FPS tracking) with the deep understanding of Gemini (semantic analysis) for a balanced, responsive experience.
-   **Efficient Quota Management**: Implemented client-side limits and optimized prompts to ensure sustainable use of the specialized Gemini models.
-   **Universal Environment Config**: A robust configuration service that seamlessly handles API keys across local development (Vite) and production environments.
