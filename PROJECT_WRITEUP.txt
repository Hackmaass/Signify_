PROJECT WRITEUP: Signify

PROJECT NAME: Signify - Your Personal AI-Powered ASL Tutor

OVERVIEW:
Signify is an innovative, gamified education platform designed to make learning American Sign Language (ASL) accessible, interactive, and effective. By leveraging advanced webcam-based hand tracking and state-of-the-art AI, Signify provides a "Live Tutor" experience that watches you sign and offers instant, personalized corrections—just like a real teacher.

KEY FEATURES:

1.  📷 Real-Time Hand Tracking
    -   Utilizes **Google MediaPipe** to defect 21 distinct landmarks on your hands directly in the browser (client-side).
    -   Privacy-focused: Video feeds are processed locally or sent securely only when active AI feedback is requested.

2.  🤖 AI-Powered Live Tutor
    -   **Real-Time Feedback**: Powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Native**, the system analyzes video frames of your hands.
    -   **Correction Engine**: Detects errors in form (e.g., "Thumb correction needed") and provides specific, actionable advice.
    -   **Interactive Voice**: The AI speaks to you using synthesized speech (Zephyr voice), guiding you through lessons with encouragement.

3.  📚 Smart Curriculum & Custom Lessons
    -   **Static Lessons**: Master the basics with A-Z alphabet tutorials.
    -   **Dynamic Phrases**: Learn complex words like "Hello", utilizing motion tracking algorithms.
    -   **AI Generator**: Type *any* word or phrase, and the system instantly generates a custom lesson plan using Generative AI.

4.  🔥 Gamification
    -   Daily Streak tracking to build momentum.
    -   Quota Tracker: Visualizes your daily API usage to keep learning sustainable.
    -   Progress badges and unlockable achievements.

5.  🎨 Modern Aesthetic
    -   Designed with a "Glassmorphism" UI using **Tailwind CSS**.
    -   Features smooth Framer Motion animations and a sleek dark mode.
